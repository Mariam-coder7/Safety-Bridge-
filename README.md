##  Configuration

### Sensor Calibration
- System automatically calibrates vibration sensor on startup
- Requires 5-10 seconds of no movement during initialization
- Baseline value stored for accurate vibration detection

### Threshold Adjustment
```cpp
const int minorVibThreshold = 30;     // Adjust for sensitivity
const int majorVibThreshold = 100;    // Adjust for local conditions
const int earthquakeThreshold = 200;  // Critical level threshold
int waterThreshold = 500;             // Flood detection level
```

##  Data Flow

1. **Sensor Reading** (Every 50ms)
   - Vibration sensor: Analog reading processed against baseline
   - Water sensor: Analog reading compared to threshold

2. **State Processing** (Continuous)
   - Analyze sensor data
   - Determine appropriate system state
   - Execute state-specific actions

3. **Data Logging** (Every 30 seconds)
   - Send sensor readings to Supabase
   - Publish MQTT messages
   - Log gate operations and alerts

4. **Emergency Response** (Immediate)
   - Critical alerts sent instantly to Supabase
   - Gate operations logged with reason
   - MQTT emergency broadcasts

## üéõÔ∏è Remote Control

### MQTT Commands
```bash
# Open/Close Gate 1
mosquitto_pub -h YOUR_BROKER -u USER -P PASS -t "bridge/gates/gate1/cmd" -m "OPEN"
mosquitto_pub -h YOUR_BROKER -u USER -P PASS -t "bridge/gates/gate1/cmd" -m "CLOSE"

# Open/Close Gate 2  
mosquitto_pub -h YOUR_BROKER -u USER -P PASS -t "bridge/gates/gate2/cmd" -m "OPEN"
mosquitto_pub -h YOUR_BROKER -u USER -P PASS -t "bridge/gates/gate2/cmd" -m "CLOSE"
```

**Note:** Manual commands are rejected during emergency states for safety.

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-time Monitoring

- Local LCD display for on-site status

### Data Analysis Queries
```sql
-- Recent vibration patterns
SELECT vibration_level, max_vibration, timestamp 
FROM sensor_readings 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Emergency events
SELECT alert_type, severity, message, timestamp 
FROM system_alerts 
WHERE severity = 'CRITICAL'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Gate operation history
SELECT gate_number, action, trigger_reason, timestamp 
FROM gate_operations 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## üõ° Safety Features

- **Fail-Safe Design:** Emergency states override manual commands
- **Redundant Monitoring:** Both current and peak vibration levels checked
- **Evacuation Protocol:** Exit gates open during emergencies
- **Data Persistence:** All events logged for analysis
- **Remote Monitoring:** Cloud-based oversight capability

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**WiFi Connection Failed**
- Check SSID and password
- Ensure 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Verify signal strength

**MQTT Connection Issues**
- Verify broker credentials and URL
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure SSL/TLS settings match broker requirements

**Sensor Calibration Problems**
- Keep system still during startup calibration
- Check sensor wiring and connections
- Verify 3.3V power supply to sensors

**Supabase Upload Errors**
- Verify Supabase URL and API key
- Check table schemas match code
- Ensure RLS policies allow insertions
