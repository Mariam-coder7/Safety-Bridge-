# Safety Bridge

Bridges in low-lying or unstable regions are highly vulnerable to flooding and seismic activity.
Sudden rises in water levels or unexpected shocks can pose serious risks to both traffic and structural safety. 
Many current monitoring systems lack affordable, automated local alerts and flexible manual override options. 
This project introduces a low-cost, safety-focused bridge monitoring solution designed to provide early warnings,
enhance resilience, and protect both infrastructure and commuters.
